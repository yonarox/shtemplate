## Developed by

Andres Aquino <andres.aquino(at)gmail.com>


## Source Code

[GitHub]       http://andresaquino.github.com/shtemplate


## Overview

Our objetive was to build a template to build and execute batch processes,
with intention of homologate all manners of work or develop until then, as
consequence of work with many differents point of view. When we saw the 
facility with that a RoR (Ruby on Rails) application is build, then we think
"hey, we need something like that here.." because until these moment we had
been work with too many different structures and obviously, to many problems 
and bugs to resolve.
